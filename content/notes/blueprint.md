# what is this for?
this blog is one step in the direction of [[notes/unstucking_myself|"UnStucking" myself]]. i have been stuck for a while, caught by my insistence on things being perfect before i release them into the world. this has reached a stage of being unhelpful (mostly) and i want to break the cycle. 

i write a lot. like, almost every day. writing my thoughts down is illuminating, but i've built up a mentality whereby i isolate these thoughts. though some thoughts are obviously best kept to myself, i'm out of balance. this website is me making strides back to the direction of balance.
