maps are invaluable assets for adventurers. think of this page as a 'central hub', from which you can find entry points into areas of interest.

# maps, tags and searches, oh my!
this site is intentionally designed to be enjoyable to navigate, and so there are a few options for finding a note that interests you. 

firstly you have a map--like this page--that houses links to other pages with *context* provided. that is, i've provided a summary of linked notes however feels most natural. 

if however you'd prefer to simply see all notes tagged in a certain way, the tags page is for you. you can browse through a growing list of notes related to that tag and take it from there. i've even made a spicy move to tag all my maps with the #map tag, so you can view a list of all maps [here](/tags/Map) 

the final option is the search bar in the top-right of every page. click this or use `Ctrl + K` to *quickly* find a phrase or word anywhere within my writing

# blueprint
a blueprint is a model or prototype. this idea is helpful for me as i build a life full of meaning. from where i'm standing, there are ideas like shining lights beckoning me towards them. to intentionally move in the direction of purpose, i've built a work-in-progress plan of action--a [[notes/blueprint map]]--that can guide me through the tumultuous road ahead

find all notes with the blueprint tag [here](/tags/Blueprint)

# data science / machine learning
data can be beautiful or boring. it can inspire insight or elicit confusion. handling data is the realm that i get to explore my creativity, curiosity and technical ability. there's an endless trove of applications and concepts to be documented, which is where this website comes in.

in the timeless lyrics of Phil Collins: "in learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn". the abundance of free, powerful tools and easily accessible data means that anybody can be a scientist. permission from an academic institution is *not* required. all that you need is the know-how, and in building up my own i hope to teach you something along the way.

data science and machine learning often go hand in hand, but not always. as such they have distinct maps and tags:
- machine learning tags are [here](/tags/ML), and the map [[notes/machine learning map|here|]] 
- for data science, [here](/tags/datascience) is the tagged notes, and the map [[notes/data science map|here]]
