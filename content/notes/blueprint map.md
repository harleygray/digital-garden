# what is this for?
crafting a life full of meaning. this is my ambitious north star, and though i can't see the full picture of this, i *can* see the direction. by focusing on the tools, technology and people that resonate with me, i hope to aim at my higher ideal with ever increasing clarity. 

i imagine my curious spirit as a light that guides my attention. up until recently it had been wandering off on its own, leaving me feeling lost. reconnecting with that light has been my quest, with the hopeful reward of being guided back to a path of excitement and purpose.

it's difficult to find meaning in life without anything guiding us. we may start to indulge in things that feel good in the moment, but those eventually lose their lustre. we need something to strive for, something that inspires us to take action each day

# what is a blueprint?
a blueprint is an action plan. it's a focal point for people (or one person collaborating with themselves) to concentrate their energy. large projects require coordination, therefore creating a plan--even one that will be updated--makes success more likely.

what is success? what am i creating a blueprint *of*? if everything went perfectly, i'd be:
1. contributing to a cause larger than myself
2. building in public - website, tweets, applets
3. learning about interesting technology through experimentation
4. helping my community with remaining resources

number 1. is the north star, but it is the point that i've been struggling with for months now. it's becoming clearer, but in trying too hard to find it i've become stuck. by contrast, 2, 3 and 4 are within my grasp *now*. by starting with these three, i hope that 1. becomes more clear

# how to progress
## contribute
i am searching for narrative and digital technology to help us solve the immense challenges we face. we have the tools, but we lack a story that unites us. 

technologies that i believe are part of a solution are:
- [holochain](https://www.holochain.org/), an end-to-end open source P2P app framework 
- language models, particularly implementations such as [Irises](https://twitter.com/CognicistIris)
- decentralised protocols generally

each of these technologies are in their infancy. their development will influence, and be influenced by, the desires of individuals as well as the global zeitgeist. i'm optimistic about the potential of these technologies and want to be a part of a team using them to help people work together

## build
### writing and tweeting
this blog is one step in the direction of [[notes/unstucking_myself|"UnStucking" myself]]. i have been stuck for a while, caught by my insistence on things being perfect before i release them into the world. this has reached a stage of being unhelpful (mostly) and i want to break the cycle. also, i've been making a concerted effort into tweeting more. part of feeling Stuck was imagining that i have nothing to say...which isn't true. 

i write a lot. like, almost every day. writing my thoughts down is illuminating, but i've built up a mindset causing me to isolate these thoughts. though some thoughts are obviously best kept to myself, i'm out of balance. this website is me making strides back to the direction of balance.

### tech projects
as part of [fast.ai's deep learning course](https://course.fast.ai/), i'm building and sharing machine-learning based applets. currently in progress is a hand-gesture recognition model that will help me document my mindset moving forward. more on in this space will be linked to [[notes/data science map|here]]

## learn
recently i've had an 'aha!' moment: that learning to harness the power of machine learning is something that *feels* right. but there is so much to learn. not only about how this rapidly advancing technology works, but how the mis-use of it can cause harm. surely when Prometheus stole fire, a few villages burned themselves to the ground. minimising the harm of this technology needs to be taken into account as we wield the power of the gods.

learning and building go hand-in-hand, and so i believe that working through [fast.ai's deep learning course](https://course.fast.ai/) and documenting my progress will move me forward in this direction.

## help
finally, but no less importantly, i want to lift others up. a rising tide lifts all ships. i don't have a grand plan on how to do this at a large scale, but i do know things that work on a small one. 

i've joined my local emergency services in response to increasing natural disasters occuring world-wide. though i haven't responded to a catastrophic event yet, i am training to do so because i know it's coming. training is a weekly endeavour (which is exhausting in its own right) that i've commited to already and will likely write about here in due course.

on a personal level, i strive to listen always and offer help when it's needed. i don't always get this right, nor do i always have the energy to do so. i have a habit of giving too much of myself when i'm stretched thin, which isn't good for anyone. part of helping others means putting the oxygen mask on myself first. this way i can have more of myself to give
