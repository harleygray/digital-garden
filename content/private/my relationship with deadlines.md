title: "my relationship with deadlines"
---


i'm realising lately that i think about deadlines funnily. i almost never do things *on time*, but i do get around to them if they're important to me. what's important is the focus. it's the wish you make upon a star, and bring into existence. but i've got to have the foresight to know what i'm wishing for. 

what is the question i don't want to ask? what is the conversation i don't want to have? who is the person that makes me feel most vulnerable and afraid?

all we have to do is take the first step. 

i am most scared of disappointing myself. because i know that i have done so before and it doesn't feel good. that sense of disappointment in myself.. where does that come from? if it comes from my belief that i need to be successful in order to be worthy of love and respect. 

that sense of feeling that i must attain success actually takes away from my curious spirit. it means that i have to *work* rather than *play*. i am much more powerful when i'm playing. there are ways that i can set expectations of myself in such a way that it is a superpower, too. *play with the concept of setting expectations*

i think one things that is true is that knowing what i'm working towards is helpful for me. i actually like waking up at 5:30am but i have to have something to *do* otherwise i won't stay up.
