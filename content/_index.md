# hi, welcome
thanks for stopping by! this is my digital garden; a space to share my musings. like any garden, there are parts that are fully matured, some still growing, and others that have only just sprouted. 

# a note from your tour guide
this website allows you to visualise how my notes are connected with each other, and encourages you to read in a non-linear manner. the 'interactive graph' at the bottom of the page will show you what thoughts live in the neighbourhood of this one.

i will link to other notes related to the one you're currently on. to save you time, i'll mostly link to fully developed ideas, but you can find notes that are still 'growing' if you care to.  

my strategy to craft a meaningful life can be found [[notes/blueprint map|here]]

if you're into machine learning, this [[notes/catch these hands, please|ai can tell what hand gesture you're making]]

lfg!!
