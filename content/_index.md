# hi
This is my first edit to my website! 


# welcome
this is my space to share fascinating things that i'm learning. i'm learning about website design as i go! my hope is that your time here is as enjoyable as mine was creating it :)


# digital garden
this website allows you to visualise how my notes are connected with each other, and encourages you to read in a non-linear manner. the 'interactive graph' at the bottom of the page will show you what thoughts live in the neighbourhood of this one.



If you prefer browsing the contents of this site through a list instead of a graph, you see a list of all [setup-related notes](/notes/setup).
