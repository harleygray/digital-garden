# digital garden
this website allows you to visualise how my notes are connected with each other, and encourages you to read in a non-linear manner. the 'interactive graph' at the bottom of the page will show you what thoughts live in the neighbourhood of this one.

[here](/digital-garden/notes/first_post.md) is my first note!

[[first_post]] test 1
[[first_post.md]] test 2
[test 3](notes/first_post.md)
[test 4](https://harleygray.github.io/digital-garden/notes/first_post/)

If you prefer browsing the contents of this site through a list instead of a graph, you see a list of all [[digital-garden/notes/setup.md|setup related notes]]
