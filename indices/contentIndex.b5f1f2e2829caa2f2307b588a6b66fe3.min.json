You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'Ù…Ø¯ÙˆÙ†ØªÙŠ'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-30T21:49:29.395597201Z","tags":null},"/notes/data-science-map":{"title":"data science map","content":"\nempty, for now!","lastmodified":"2022-09-30T21:49:29.395597201Z","tags":null},"/notes/machine-learning-map":{"title":"machine learning map","content":"\nempty, for now!","lastmodified":"2022-09-30T21:49:29.403597245Z","tags":null},"/notes/map-of-maps":{"title":"map of maps","content":"\nmaps are invaluable assets for adventurers. think of this page as a 'central hub', from which you can find entry points into areas of interest. \n\n![[notes/images/Lumbridge_map.png]]\n\n# maps, tags and searches, oh my!\nthis site is intentionally designed to be enjoyable to navigate, and so there are a few options for finding a note that interests you. \n\nfirstly you have a map--like this page--that houses links to other pages with *context* provided. that is, i've provided a summary of linked notes however feels most natural. \n\nif however you'd prefer to simply see all notes tagged in a certain way, the tags page is for you. you can browse through a growing list of notes related to that tag and take it from there. i've even made a spicy move to tag all my maps with the #map tag, so you can view a list of all maps [here](/tags/Map) \n\nthe final option is the search bar in the top-right of every page. click this or use `Ctrl + K` to *quickly* find a phrase or word anywhere within my writing\n\n# blueprint\na blueprint is a model or prototype. this idea is helpful for me as i build a life full of meaning. from where i'm standing, there are ideas like shining lights beckoning me towards them. to intentionally move in the direction of purpose, i've built a work-in-progress plan of action--a [[notes/blueprint map]]--that can guide me through the tumultuous road ahead\n\nfind all notes with the blueprint tag [here](/tags/Blueprint)\n\n# data science / machine learning\ndata can be beautiful or boring. it can inspire insight or elicit confusion. handling data is the realm that i get to explore my creativity, curiosity and technical ability. there's an endless trove of applications and concepts to be documented, which is where this website comes in.  \n\n\u003e [!quote] why i'm blogging\n\u003e\n\u003e You are best positioned to help people one step behind you.\n\u003e \n\u003e -[ Rachel Thomas](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045)\n\nin the timeless lyrics of Phil Collins: \"in learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn\". the abundance of free, powerful tools and easily accessible data means that anybody can be a scientist. permission from an academic institution is *not* required. all that you need is the know-how, and in building up my own i hope to teach you something along the way.\n\ndata science and machine learning often go hand in hand, but not always. as such they have distinct maps and tags:\n- machine learning tags are [here](/tags/ML), and the map [[notes/machine learning map|here|]] \n- for data science, [here](/tags/datascience) is the tagged notes, and the map [[notes/data science map|here]] \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-30T21:49:29.403597245Z","tags":null},"/notes/unstucking_myself":{"title":"UnStucking Myself","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-09-30T21:49:29.403597245Z","tags":null}}
